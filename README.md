## ‚ú® Features

-   **Stunning Hero Section:** A dynamic hero section featuring a night sky background, an animated gradient border on the profile picture, and vibrant gradient text.
-   **Dual-Theme Mode:** Seamlessly switch between a custom light theme (light blue) and a stunning dark theme with a single click.
-   **Interactive & Animated UI:** Built with Framer Motion to provide smooth page transitions, scroll-based fade-in animations, and sophisticated micro-interactions.
-   **Sophisticated Navigation:** A "magic underline" navigation bar that fluidly slides to indicate the active section as you scroll. It collapses into a clean, animated hamburger menu on mobile.
-   **Interactive Experience Section:** An elegant accordion layout that allows visitors to explore each job role in detail without cluttering the initial view.
-   **"Two-Slide" Project Cards:** A unique card design where users can click to "flip" or "slide" to a detailed, scrollable description of each project.
-   **Advanced Styling:** Features a cohesive and vibrant color palette, custom-designed cards with patterns/frames, and a "glassmorphism" aesthetic.
-   **Fully Responsive:** Meticulously designed to provide a seamless experience on all devices, from large desktop monitors to mobile phones.
